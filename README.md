# table_js

Used to hide or show some column of a table.
The inital idea of this js is when I need to create a table of too many columns. So I created this js to control the hidden column and shown column.

the hidden column should be added a class of col-hide and shown column should be added a class of col-show. the column should always be shown should be added none.

this js needs to be inital before the page was loaded. The example will be shown in the file.
